      "text": "Upgraded form of the high capacitor, sacrificing recharge rate for artron capacity. Stores up to 1024 AU per capacitor, for a total of 10,240 AU, and a recharge rate of 0.5. Incredibly expensive to make, and is the first capacitor to require an advanced Quantiscope to craft. Can be upgraded with speed capacitors to make the temporal capacitor."
