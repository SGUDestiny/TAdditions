Stores up to 2048 AU per capacitor, for a total of 20,480 AU, and a recharge rate of 7.0. Requires an advanced Quantiscope and a lot of materials to craft. Not for the faint of heart."

Can hold up to 11,000 AU per battery, with a charge rate of 7.5, and a discharge rate of 0.17. Less expensive than its capacitor counterpart, but still fairly expensive for a battery. Requires an advanced Quantiscope to craft."
