      "text": "The most rudimentary artron capacitor. Stores up to 64 AU per capacitor for a total of 640 AU, and a recharge rate of 0.5. Can be made from scratch or repaired from a leaky capacitor. Ideally best used when in great numbers. Most capacitors will require a Quantiscope to craft. Can be upgraded into a medium capacitor."

      "text": "The most rudimentary artron battery. Can be charged in a TARDIS engine, or in an arton collector. Used to power vortex manipulators. Can hold up to 250 AU per battery, with a charge rate of 0.5 and a discharge rate of 0.65. Most batteries will require a Quantiscope to be crafted. Can be upgraded into the medium battery."
