      "text": "TARDISes cannot be crafted nor created, you must find one previously owned and discarded. There are three primary ways to find a TARDIS. The first and most reliable is finding a village with a Storyteller residing there, found in Observatory buildings. In exchange for some emeralds, you may be given an artifact map, which can lead you directly to an abandoned TARDIS underground. The second is by ringing a placed bell. If a TARDIS is within range of the bell, it will respond by ringing its bloister bells, showing it is near. The third relies on simple luck. You might accidentally stumble upon one when mining or spelunking. How lucky!"
