      "text": " Upgraded form of the high capacitor, sacrificing artron capacity for recharge rate. Stores up to 128 AU per capacitor, for a total of 1,280 AU, and a recharge rate of 4.0. Immensely useful, and much cheaper to make than the ultra capacitor. Can be upgraded with ultra capacitors into the temporal capacitor."
